## Step 1: Obtain an IDS Activation Code
 
An IDS Activation Code is a 20-digit alphanumeric code that is used to activate a license for IDS software. You can obtain an IDS Activation Code from the Professional Technicians Society (PTS) website, which is the official source of technical information and support for Ford dealerships. To access the PTS website, you need to have a valid PTS user ID and password.
 
To get an IDS Activation Code from the PTS website, follow these steps:
 
- Go to [https://www.fordtechservice.dealerconnection.com/](https://www.fordtechservice.dealerconnection.com/) and log in with your PTS user ID and password.
- Select the Rotunda tab and choose IDS Software Licensing from the dropdown list.
- An IDS Software Licenses screen will display a list of Activation Codes within your dealership. Consult your dealership management for policies governing distribution of these Activation Codes.
- Copy or write down the Activation Code that you need for your IDS software.

## Step 2: Enter the IDS Activation Code
 
After obtaining an IDS Activation Code, you need to enter it in the IDS software to activate your license. To do this, follow these steps:
