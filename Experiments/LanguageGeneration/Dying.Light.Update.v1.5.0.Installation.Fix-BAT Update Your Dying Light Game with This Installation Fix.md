This fix will restore some unnecessary game files that were deleted by Steam during the update process, which caused the game to refuse to start.
 
## Step 1: Download the Installation Fix
 
The first step is to download the installation fix from one of the following links:

The file size is about 4 MB and it contains a folder named "Dying.Light.Update.v1.5.0.Installation.Fix-BAT". Extract the folder to your desktop or any other location.
 
## Step 2: Copy the Files to the Game Directory
 
The next step is to copy the files from the folder "Dying.Light.Update.v1.5.0.Installation.Fix-BAT" to your game directory, where you have installed Dying Light. The default location is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Dying Light". If you have changed the location, you can find it by right-clicking on Dying Light in your Steam library, selecting "Properties", clicking on the "Local Files" tab, and then clicking on "Browse Local Files".
 
Once you have located your game directory, copy all the files from the folder "Dying.Light.Update.v1.5.0.Installation.Fix-BAT" and paste them into your game directory, overwriting any existing files if prompted.
