# Environmental Engineering By B.c Punmia.pdf: A Comprehensive Guide to Water Supply and Waste Water Engineering
  
Environmental engineering is a branch of engineering that applies the principles of science and engineering to improve and maintain the environment. Environmental engineers work on various aspects of environmental protection, such as air quality, water quality, waste management, renewable energy, and environmental impact assessment.
  
One of the most popular and useful books on environmental engineering is Environmental Engineering By B.c Punmia.pdf. This book is written by Dr. B.C. Punmia, a former professor and head of the Department of Civil Engineering at M.B.M. Engineering College, Jodhpur, India. The book is divided into two volumes: Volume 1 covers water supply engineering, and Volume 2 covers waste water engineering and air pollution.

In this article, we will focus on Volume 1 of Environmental Engineering By B.c Punmia.pdf, which deals with water supply engineering. Water supply engineering is the sub-discipline of environmental engineering that deals with the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of water supply systems. Water supply systems include sources of water, treatment plants, distribution networks, storage facilities, and plumbing fixtures.
  
Water supply engineering is essential for providing safe and adequate water for domestic, industrial, agricultural, and recreational purposes. Water supply engineering also helps to prevent waterborne diseases, conserve water resources, and protect the environment from water pollution.
  
Volume 1 of Environmental Engineering By B.c Punmia.pdf covers the following topics:
  
- Introduction to water supply engineering
- Water demand and quantity
- Water quality and standards
- Water sources and their development
- Water treatment processes
- Water distribution systems
- Pumps and pumping stations
- Water storage tanks and reservoirs
- Rural water supply schemes
- Plumbing systems

The book is written in a clear and concise manner, with numerous examples, illustrations, tables, charts, and diagrams. The book also includes solved problems, exercises, objective questions, and references for further reading. The book is suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate students of civil engineering, environmental engineering, public health engineering, and related disciplines. The book is also useful for practicing engineers, consultants, researchers, and policy makers in the field of water supply engineering.
