The Swahili Bible is a translation of the original Hebrew and Greek texts of the Old and New Testaments. The first Swahili translation of the Bible was completed in 1890 by a team of missionaries led by Johann Ludwig Krapf. Since then, several revisions and updates have been made to improve the accuracy and readability of the Swahili Bible. The most widely used version today is the Swahili Union Version, which was published in 1952.
 
The Swahili Bible is not only a sacred book for Christians, but also a valuable resource for learning and appreciating the Swahili language and culture. Swahili is a Bantu language that has been influenced by Arabic, Persian, Portuguese, English, and other languages over the centuries. It is spoken by about 100 million people in East Africa and beyond. The Swahili Bible reflects the rich history and diversity of the Swahili people, as well as their faith and devotion to God.
